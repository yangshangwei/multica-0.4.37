// What the two sides must agree on is the capability TOKEN, not a version.
//
// This replaces a test that pinned MinLocalWorktreeCLIVersion against a
// frontend twin. That twin is gone: since MUL-5707 nothing on either side gates
// on the version, and the frontend no longer even quotes it (#7113), so the old
// contract was pinning a number the UI does not show. The server constant stays
// because the 422 payload still carries it, but it has no counterpart to match.
//
// The token does have one, and it is load-bearing in a way a version never was:
// the daemon advertises this exact string, the server stores it, and the UI
// looks for it. A typo on either side silently disables worktree mode for
// everyone, with no error anywhere — which is precisely the failure this whole
// area keeps producing.
// This test reads OUT of the Go module, so CI's backend path filter has to
// list the frontend file explicitly (`backend` in .github/workflows/ci.yml).
// Without it, a PR that only edits the frontend token skips the very test
// that would catch the mismatch. Move or rename the path below and the
// filter must move with it.
