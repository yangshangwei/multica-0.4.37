// parent-status contract is split across two systems that never see each
// other: the squad briefing (server-side, appended to the leader's
// Instructions) and the runtime brief (daemon-side CLAUDE.md). Asserting each
// half in isolation is exactly how the original contradiction shipped — the
// briefing said "move it to in_review when the goal is met" while the runtime
// brief said "do not change status unless the comment asks", and a member's
// delivery comment never asks.
//
// So each test assembles both halves for one real scenario and asserts the
// combined instruction set points one way.
