// lockFileExclusiveNonBlocking takes an exclusive lock on f without waiting.
// ok is false when another process already holds it.
//
// Windows releases the lock when the handle closes, including on abnormal
// process termination, giving the same crash-safe liveness answer as flock on
// unix — see the unix build of this file for why that property matters.
// openLockFile opens (creating if needed) the lock file with
// FILE_SHARE_DELETE, which os.OpenFile does not request.
//
// Without it Windows refuses to delete a file that anyone still has open, so a
// held lock would pin the whole env root: the GC could not reclaim the
// directory, and neither could a test's temp-dir teardown. Unix already allows
// unlinking an open file, and this is what makes Windows behave the same. The
// lock coordinates executions; it is not meant to pin the directory.
