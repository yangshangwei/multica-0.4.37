 * `{status: "done"}`, and a bare `{...issue, ...patch}` therefore keeps the
 * STALE `status_category: "todo"` while the card moves to the done bucket. A
 * single update self-heals when the full server response lands, but the batch
 * API returns only `{updated: n}` and does not refetch bucketed lists — so
 * without this the entity stays permanently inconsistent with the bucket it
 * sits in, and the next off-window count decrements the wrong bucket.
 *
 * A patch that does not touch `status` is returned unchanged. A custom key with
 * no authoritative category is left alone too: it is unresolvable, and

/**
 * How an exact status-key filter resolves to board/list COLUMNS (MUL-6243).

 * Three states, not two. Built-in keys resolve with no catalog at all, because

 * answers `todo` for anything it has not loaded, which is indistinguishable
 * from a real `todo`. Routing on that guess paged the todo column for a saved
 * `qa` filter while the query still restricted `status=qa`.
 *
 * Returning an empty column set for that case is equally wrong: the caller
 * cannot tell "narrow to nothing" from "cannot answer yet", so it fetched no
 * branches and rendered an empty board with no spinner and no error. Hence the
 * explicit state:
 *
 * - `resolved` — every key answered; `columns` is authoritative.
 * - `pending`  — a custom key needs a catalog that is still in flight. Hold the
 *                surface's loading state; do not fetch and do not render empty.
 * - `error`    — the catalog request failed. Show a retryable error; a custom
 *                filter cannot be honoured without it.
