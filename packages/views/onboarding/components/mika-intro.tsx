/**
 * The subject of step 3, stated as an object rather than a footnote.
 *
 * The step used to be titled after its dependency — "Pick an agent runtime" —
 * with Mika named only in the grey lede. That put the thing being created in
 * the small print and the technical prerequisite in the headline, so a member
 * reached a button saying "Start with Mika" without ever being told who that
 * is. Headline plus a card with a mark on it is what makes the introduction
 * survive not reading carefully.
 *
 * Mika does not exist yet at this point in the flow — she is created when the
 * member commits — so this cannot render her stored avatar. It reuses the mark
 * the Runtimes page already uses for "Start with Mika" instead, which keeps
 * the two entry points recognisably the same thing.
