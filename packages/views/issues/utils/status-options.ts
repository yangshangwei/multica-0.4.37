 * The statuses a user can pick or filter by, as one flat list in canonical
 * category order (MUL-6243, MUL-6399).
 *
 * Category is carried per option rather than expressed as a heading: it is the
 * behavior a status inherits, which the icon and hover color already say, and
 * a heading per category turned a 7-row list into 14 rows of half whitespace.
 *
 * Shared by the status picker and the status filter so the two can never drift
 * — a status offered in one and missing from the other is exactly how an issue
 * becomes unfindable.
 *
 * Archived statuses are excluded by default: archiving retires a status from
 * future assignment. A read-only filter can opt specific current keys back in
 * through `includeArchivedKeys`, so existing issues remain findable without a
 * picker offering a retired value for assignment.
